# ADR-004: Make all menus and mouse and any distractions fade when the user doesn't move the mouse or type for X time, to make it as immersive as possible.

## Summary

Make all menus, the topbar, and the mouse fade away from view after a few seconds of inactivity. Then when activity is detected, the menus, the topbar, and the mouse fade back in.

## Why?

To bring the experience as close as possible to actually looking through a real telescope (where you would only see the sky and the stars and no menus or anything else).

## Stretch Goal: WASD/Arrow Keys to move the telescope in this 'focused' mode.

Make it so that you can use WASD or the arrow keys to move the telescope in this mode. Make an indicator pop up and flash on the screen then move to the bottom that tells the user they can use WASD or the arrow keys to move the telescope. Keep the telescope in this mode until other keys are pressed or the mouse is moved.
