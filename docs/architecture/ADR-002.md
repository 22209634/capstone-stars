# ADR-002: CSS Code - components = styling, pages = layout

## Summary

- When writing CSS code, ensure that styling code remains with the component itself under src/components/<component-name-here> but no positional styling is written there. Keep positional styling with the pages only under src/pages/<page-name-here>.
  - This will allow for easier code reuse, and keep a clear separation of concerns, as well as help to keep things organised.
