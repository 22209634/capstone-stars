# AI-Oriented Specifications

This document is a working spec for our app oriented towards AI, to:

- Help AI better understand the app and make more meaningful contributions to discussions, designs, code, testing, and more.

# Mission and Problem Statement

**Core mission:** a web-enabled app that lets users remotely control a telescope/mount, watch live video feeds (telescope feed and all-sky camera feed), select visible astronomical objects from a list (and then be able to slew the telescope to those objects if desired), and capture images + metadata for education and research.

**Main users:** Students/Teachers (public outreach), Researchers (imagery and data capture), and System Admins (safety, access, audit).

**Success looks like:** low-latency control + video in standard browsers; correct visibility filtering; safe ops under weather constraints; easy image capture + download; clear role-based access.
